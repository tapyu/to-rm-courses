# Algorithms implemented throughout my academic life

Here you will find:
- [x] Algorithms implemented by me during courses, workshops, webinars, etc.
- [x] Further information about the events from where these algorithms were developed.
- [x] Book and other resource materials (videos, online courses, etc) for a more in-depth study of each algorithm.
- [x] Laboratory or computational homework slides, if the implemented algorithms come from these materials.
- [x] Code references developed by others, possibly during the same event where I've built mine.
- [x] Package references that implement such algorithms.

Here you won't find:
- [ ] Book PDFs or theoretical lectures slides.
- [ ] Software
