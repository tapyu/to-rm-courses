# Applied Computational Intelligence

This directory contains:
- The homework from my PhD. course "InteligÃªncia Computacional Aplicada", taught by Guilherme de Alencar Barreto at UFC.
- This course covers Computational Intelligence (CI) algorithms, which is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that develops computational models and algorithms that can exhibit intelligent behavior by mimicking the functioning of the human brain or other natural systems. The following branches of CI are studied in this course:
    - Artificial Neural Networks
    - Metaheuristics
    - Fuzzy logic
- All homeworks are in `./exercises/`
- PS: The compressed `.zip` file contains the code from colleges for the same course.
