## Digital Signal Processing

This directory contains:
- Homework from my Bsc. course in digital signal processing taught by AntÃ´nio Macilio Pereira de Lucena at Unifor -> the `Lab_{1..5}_PDS/`
- The file `lucasabdalah_Courses-HWs_Master.zip` contains another DSP course, in which I wasn't a student. Therefore, it should be analyzed separately.
