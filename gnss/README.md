# Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)

This directory contains a compendium of algorithms for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Such algorithms focus on the following topics:
- GNSS Signal Processing.
- [GNSS Data Processing](gnn-data-processing).
- Ionospheric Scintillation modeling.

- These algorithms implemented here come from different places, specially:
  1. Galileo Masterclass Brazil (GMB), taught in Fortaleza, Brazil, by [Professors from group of Astronomy and GEomatics (gAGE)][1], from Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, UPC.
  2. Lectures on "GNSS Data Processing", taught in Barcelona, Spain, by Professors [Prof. Dr. Jaume Sanz Subirana][2] and [Guillermo Gonzalez Casado][3] in 2024.1.
