# Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)

This directory contains a compendium of algorithms for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Such algorithms focus on the following topics:
- In GNSS Signal Processing.
  - Code and correlation.
  - Signal Acquisition.
  - Parameter tracking.
- In [GNSS Data Processing](gnn-data-processing):
  - Model Component Analysis.
  - Navigation equation solution.

- These algorithms implemented here come from different places, specially:
  1. [GIC] [Masterclass Brazil 2022 (GMB): ​​​​​​From Fundamentals to Signal and Data Processing][2] - taught in Fortaleza, Brazil, by [Professors from group of Astronomy and GEomatics (gAGE)][1], from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, UPC.
  2. Lectures on "GNSS Data Processing", taught in Barcelona, Spain, by Professors Prof. Dr. [Jaume Sanz Subirana] and [Guillermo Gonzalez Casado] in 2024.1.
