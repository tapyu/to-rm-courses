# GNSS Data Processing

This directory contains algorithm solutions for computational exercises on GNSS Data Processing. These algorithms were developed during two events:
- Galileo Masterclass Brazil (GMB) 2022.
- The course "GNSS Data Processing", taught by Prof. Dr. [Jaume Sanz Subirana] and Prof. Dr. [Guillermo Gonzalez Casado], at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, UPC, Spain.

The algorithms can be found [here].

The algorithms cover the following topics:
- Model Component Analysis.
- Navigation equation solution.
