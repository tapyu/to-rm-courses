# GNSS Signal Processing

This directory contains algorithm solutions for computational exercises on GNSS Signal Processing.
- These algorithms were developed during two events:
  - Galileo Masterclass Brazil (GMB) 2022.
  - The course "GNSS Signal Processing", taught by Prof. Dr. [Felix Antreich], at Aeronautics Institute of Technology, ITA, Brazil.
- The [algorithms] cover the following topics:
  - Code and correlation.
  - Signal Acquisition.
  - Parameter tracking.
