# GNSS Signal Processing

This directory contains algorithm solutions for computational exercises on GNSS Signal Processing. These algorithms were developed during two events:
- Galileo Masterclass Brazil (GMB) 2022.
- The course "GNSS Signal Processing", taught by Prof. Dr. [Felix Antreich], at Aeronautics Institute of Technology, ITA, Brazil.

The algorithms can be found [here].

The algorithms cover the following topics:
- Code and correlation.
- Signal Acquisition.
- Parameter tracking.
