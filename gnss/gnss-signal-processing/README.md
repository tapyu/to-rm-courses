# GNSS Signal Processing

This directory contains algorithm solutions for computational exercises on GNSS Signal Processing, taught by Prof. Dr. Felix Antreich at the Institute of Aeronautical Technology. The same algorithms are also presented during GMB 2022, taught at the Federal University of Cear√°.

The computational exercises cover the following topics:
- Code and correlation.
- Signal Acquisition.
- Parameter tracking.
