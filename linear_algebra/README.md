# Linear Algebra

This directory contains:
- The homework for a Linear Algebra course (unknown professor) in which I was a student. Therefore, the algorithms found here were implemented by other colleges that took this course.
- This Linear Algebra homework comprises a series of matrix decompositions implemented in `MATLAB`.

Other computational exercises resouces:
- [18.06 course at MIT: Linear Algebra (by Gilbert Strang)](https://github.com/mitmath/1806)
