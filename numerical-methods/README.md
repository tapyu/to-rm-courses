## Useful resouces
- Packages:
- **ODE-based problems** 
  - [`DifferentialEquations.jl`][1]: Numerically solving differential equations written in `julia`. See [all ODE solvers][8]; [recommendation for each situation][9]
    - Runge-Kutta Methods
    - Midpoint
    - Heun
    - Forward Euler method
    - Multistep Methods
- **Linear system problems**
  - [`IterativeSolvers.jl`][2]: Iterative algorithms for solving linear systems, eigensystems, and singular value problems. Examples:
    - Gauss-Seidel method
    - Jacobi iteration method
- **Numerical integration**
  - [`NumericalIntegration.jl`][3]: Simple (maybe not so reliable) numerical integration methods
    - Trapezoidal (default)
    - TrapezoidalEven
    - TrapezoidalFast
    - TrapezoidalEvenFast
    - SimpsonEven
    - SimpsonEvenFast
    - RombergEven
  - [`Integrals.jl`][4]: A more reliable numerical integration methods (maybe not all methods are exposed in Chapra)
    - Gaussâ€“Kronrod quadrature formula (a variant of Gaussian quadrature, see Chapra)
    - H-Adaptive Integration (Adaptive quadrature? If so, it is on Chapra). It uses [`HCubature.jl`][5], which is a `julia` code for the [adaptive multidimensional integration][6]
    - Monte Carlo integration (apparently it doesn't have on Chapra)
    - Gauss-Legendre quadrature (it has on Chapra)
    - `integral()` in matlab uses adaptive quadrature (see Chapra)
- **Root-finding functions**
  - [`Roots.jl`][7]:
    - Bisection-like algorithms
    - Newton's method
    - Chebyshev (it does not have on Chapra)
    - Schroder (it does not have on Chapra)
    - QuadraticInverse (it does not have on Chapra)
