        "This tutorial is for getting into the extra features for solving stiff ordinary\ndifferential equations in an efficient manner. Solving stiff ordinary\ndifferential equations requires specializing the linear solver on properties of\nthe Jacobian in order to cut down on the O(n^3) linear solve and the O(n^2)\nback-solves. Note that these same functions and controls also extend to stiff\nSDEs, DDEs, DAEs, etc.\n\n## Code Optimization for Differential Equations\n\n### Writing Efficient Code\n\nFor a detailed tutorial on how to optimize one's DifferentialEquations.jl code,\nplease see the\n[Optimizing DiffEq Code tutorial](http://tutorials.sciml.ai/html/introduction/03-optimizing_diffeq_code.html).\n\n### Choosing a Good Solver\n\nChoosing a good solver is required for getting top notch speed. General\nrecommendations can be found on the solver page (for example, the\n[ODE Solver Recommendations](https://docs.sciml.ai/dev/solvers/ode_solve)).\nThe current recommendations can be simplified to a Rosenbrock method\n(`Rosenbrock23` or `Rodas5`) for smaller (<50 ODEs) problems, ESDIRK methods\nfor slightly larger (`TRBDF2` or `KenCarp4` for <2000 ODEs), and Sundials\n`CVODE_BDF` for even larger problems. `lsoda` from\n[LSODA.jl](https://github.com/rveltz/LSODA.jl) is generally worth a try.\n\nMore details on the solver to choose can be found by benchmarking. See the\n[DiffEqBenchmarks](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqBenchmarks.jl) to\ncompare many solvers on many problems.\n\n### Check Out the Speed FAQ\n\nSee [this FAQ](https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/basics/faq/#faq_performance-1)\nfor information on common pitfalls and how to improve performance.\n\n### Setting Up Your Julia Installation for Speed\n\nJulia uses an underlying BLAS implementation for its matrix multiplications\nand factorizations. This library is automatically multithreaded and accelerates\nthe internal linear algebra of DifferentialEquations.jl. However, for optimality,\nyou should make sure that the number of BLAS threads that you are using matches\nthe number of physical cores and not the number of logical cores. See\n[this issue for more details](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/33409).\n\nTo check the number of BLAS threads, use:"

        "Additionally, in some cases Intel's MKL might be a faster BLAS than the standard\nBLAS that ships with Julia (OpenBLAS). To switch your BLAS implementation, you\ncan use [MKL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/MKL.jl) which will accelerate\nthe linear algebra routines. Please see the package for the limitations.\n\n### Use Accelerator Hardware\n\nWhen possible, use GPUs. If your ODE system is small and you need to solve it\nwith very many different parameters, see the\n[ensembles interface](https://docs.sciml.ai/dev/features/ensemble)\nand [DiffEqGPU.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqGPU.jl). If your problem\nis large, consider using a [CuArray](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CuArrays.jl)\nfor the state to allow for GPU-parallelism of the internal linear algebra.\n\n## Speeding Up Jacobian Calculations\n\nWhen one is using an implicit or semi-implicit differential equation solver,\nthe Jacobian must be built at many iterations and this can be one of the most\nexpensive steps. There are two pieces that must be optimized in order to reach\nmaximal efficiency when solving stiff equations: the sparsity pattern and the\nconstruction of the Jacobian. The construction is filling the matrix\n`J` with values, while the sparsity pattern is what `J` to use.\n\nThe sparsity pattern is given by a prototype matrix, the `jac_prototype`, which\nwill be copied to be used as `J`. The default is for `J` to be a `Matrix`,\ni.e. a dense matrix. However, if you know the sparsity of your problem, then\nyou can pass a different matrix type. For example, a `SparseMatrixCSC` will\ngive a sparse matrix. Additionally, structured matrix types like `Tridiagonal`,\n`BandedMatrix` (from\n[BandedMatrices.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/BandedMatrices.jl)),\n`BlockBandedMatrix` (from\n[BlockBandedMatrices.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/BlockBandedMatrices.jl)),\nand more can be given. DifferentialEquations.jl will internally use this matrix\ntype, making the factorizations faster by utilizing the specialized forms.\n\nFor the construction, there are 3 ways to fill `J`:\n\n- The default, which uses normal finite/automatic differentiation\n- A function `jac(J,u,p,t)` which directly computes the values of `J`\n- A `colorvec` which defines a sparse differentiation scheme.\n\nWe will now showcase how to make use of this functionality with growing complexity.\n\n### Declaring Jacobian Functions\n\nLet's solve the Rosenbrock equations:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\ndy_1 &= -0.04y₁ + 10^4 y_2 y_3 \\\\\ndy_2 &= 0.04 y_1 - 10^4 y_2 y_3 - 3*10^7 y_{2}^2 \\\\\ndy_3 &= 3*10^7 y_{3}^2 \\\\\n\\end{align}$$\n\nIn order to reduce the Jacobian construction cost, one can describe a Jacobian\nfunction by using the `jac` argument for the `ODEFunction`. First, let's do\na standard `ODEProblem`:"

        "## Using Structured Matrix Types\n\nIf your sparsity pattern follows a specific structure, for example a banded\nmatrix, then you can declare `jac_prototype` to be of that structure and then\nadditional optimizations will come for free. Note that in this case, it is\nnot necessary to provide a `colorvec` since the color vector will be analytically\nderived from the structure of the matrix.\n\nThe matrices which are allowed are those which satisfy the\n[ArrayInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ArrayInterface.jl) interface\nfor automatically-colorable matrices. These include:\n\n- Bidiagonal\n- Tridiagonal\n- SymTridiagonal\n- BandedMatrix ([BandedMatrices.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/BandedMatrices.jl))\n- BlockBandedMatrix ([BlockBandedMatrices.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/BlockBandedMatrices.jl))\n\nMatrices which do not satisfy this interface can still be used, but the matrix\ncoloring will not be automatic, and an appropriate linear solver may need to\nbe given (otherwise it will default to attempting an LU-decomposition).\n\n## Sundials-Specific Handling\n\nWhile much of the setup makes the transition to using Sundials automatic, there\nare some differences between the pure Julia implementations and the Sundials\nimplementations which must be taken note of. These are all detailed in the\n[Sundials solver documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#ode_solve_sundials-1),\nbut here we will highlight the main details which one should make note of.\n\nDefining a sparse matrix and a Jacobian for Sundials works just like any other\npackage. The core difference is in the choice of the linear solver. With Sundials,\nthe linear solver choice is done with a Symbol in the `linear_solver` from a\npreset list. Particular choices of note are `:Band` for a banded matrix and\n`:GMRES` for using GMRES. If you are using Sundials, `:GMRES` will not require\ndefining the JacVecOperator, and instead will always make use of a Jacobian-Free\nNewton Krylov (with numerical differentiation). Thus on this problem we could do:"

Let's solve the Robertson equation.\nAt the top we wrote this equation as:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\ndy_1 &= -0.04y₁ + 10^4 y_2 y_3 \\\\\ndy_2 &= 0.04 y_1 - 10^4 y_2 y_3 - 3*10^7 y_{2}^2 \\\\\ndy_3 &= 3*10^7 y_{3}^2 \\\\\n\\end{align}$$\n\nBut we can instead write this with a conservation relation:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\ndy_1 &= -0.04y₁ + 10^4 y_2 y_3 \\\\\ndy_2 &= 0.04 y_1 - 10^4 y_2 y_3 - 3*10^7 y_{2}^2 \\\\\n1 &=  y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} \\\\\n\\end{align}$$\n\nIn this form, we can write this as a mass matrix ODE where $M$ is singular\n(this is another form of a differential-algebraic equation (DAE)). Here, the\nlast row of `M` is just zero. We can implement this form as:"
