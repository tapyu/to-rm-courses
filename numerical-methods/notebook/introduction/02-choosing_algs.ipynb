The corresponding page of the documentation is the [ODE Solvers](https://docs.sciml.ai/dev/solvers/ode_solve/) page which goes into more depth.\n\n## Diagnosing Stiffness\n\nOne of the key things to know for algorithm choices is whether your problem is stiff.

        "In this particular case, we can see that non-stiff solvers get us to the solution much more quickly.\n\n## The Recommended Methods\n\nWhen picking a method, the general rules are as follows:\n\n- Higher order is more efficient at lower tolerances, lower order is more efficient at higher tolerances\n- Adaptivity is essential in most real-world scenarios\n- Runge-Kutta methods do well with non-stiff equations, Rosenbrock methods do well with small stiff equations, BDF methods do well with large stiff equations\n\nWhile there are always exceptions to the rule, those are good guiding principles. Based on those, a simple way to choose methods is:\n\n- The default is `Tsit5()`, a non-stiff Runge-Kutta method of Order 5\n- If you use low tolerances (`1e-8`), try `Vern7()` or `Vern9()`\n- If you use high tolerances, try `BS3()`\n- If the problem is stiff, try `Rosenbrock23()`, `Rodas5()`, or `CVODE_BDF()`\n- If you don't know, use `AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23())` or `AutoVern9(Rodas5())`.\n\n(This is a simplified version of the default algorithm chooser)\n\n## Comparison to other Software\n\nIf you are familiar with MATLAB, SciPy, or R's DESolve, here's a quick translation start to have transfer your knowledge over.\n\n- `ode23` -> `BS3()`\n- `ode45`/`dopri5` -> `DP5()`, though in most cases `Tsit5()` is more efficient\n- `ode23s` -> `Rosenbrock23()`, though in most cases `Rodas4()` is more efficient\n- `ode113` -> `VCABM()`, though in many cases `Vern7()` is more efficient\n- `dop853` -> `DP8()`, though in most cases `Vern7()` is more efficient\n- `ode15s`/`vode` -> `QNDF()`, though in many cases `CVODE_BDF()`, `Rodas4()`\n  or `radau()` are more efficient\n- `ode23t` -> `Trapezoid()` for efficiency and `GenericTrapezoid()` for robustness\n- `ode23tb` -> `TRBDF2`\n- `lsoda` -> `lsoda()` (requires `]add LSODA; using LSODA`)\n- `ode15i` -> `IDA()`, though in many cases `Rodas4()` can handle the DAE and is\n  significantly more efficient"
