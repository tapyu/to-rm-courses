        "In this notebook we will walk through some of the main tools for optimizing your code in order to efficiently solve DifferentialEquations.jl. User-side optimizations are important because, for sufficiently difficult problems, most of the time will be spent inside of your `f` function, the function you are trying to solve. \"Efficient\" integrators are those that reduce the required number of `f` calls to hit the error tolerance. The main ideas for optimizing your DiffEq code, or any Julia function, are the following:\n\n- Make it non-allocating\n- Use StaticArrays for small arrays\n- Use broadcast fusion\n- Make it type-stable\n- Reduce redundant calculations\n- Make use of BLAS calls\n- Optimize algorithm choice\n\nWe'll discuss these strategies in the context of small and large systems. Let's start with small systems.\n\n## Optimizing Small Systems (<100 DEs)\n\nLet's take the classic Lorenz system from before. Let's start by naively writing the system in its out-of-place form:"

        "since that's all just setup allocations.\n\n#### But if the system is small we can optimize even more.\n\nAllocations are only expensive if they are \"heap allocations\". For a more in-depth definition of heap allocations, [there are a lot of sources online](http://net-informations.com/faq/net/stack-heap.htm). But a good working definition is that heap allocations are variable-sized slabs of memory which have to be pointed to, and this pointer indirection costs time. Additionally, the heap has to be managed and the garbage controllers has to actively keep track of what's on the heap.\n\nHowever, there's an alternative to heap allocations, known as stack allocations. The stack is statically-sized (known at compile time) and thus its accesses are quick. Additionally, the exact block of memory is known in advance by the compiler, and thus re-using the memory is cheap. This means that allocating on the stack has essentially no cost!\n\nArrays have to be heap allocated because their size (and thus the amount of memory they take up) is determined at runtime. But there are structures in Julia which are stack-allocated. `struct`s for example are stack-allocated \"value-type\"s. `Tuple`s are a stack-allocated collection. The most useful data structure for DiffEq though is the `StaticArray` from the package [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl). These arrays have their length determined at compile-time. They are created using macros attached to normal array expressions, for example:"

        "Notice that the `3` after `SVector` gives the size of the `SVector`. It cannot be changed. Additionally, `SVector`s are immutable, so we have to create a new `SVector` to change values. But remember, we don't have to worry about allocations because this data structure is stack-allocated. `SArray`s have a lot of extra optimizations as well: they have fast matrix multiplication, fast QR factorizations, etc. which directly make use of the information about the size of the array. Thus, when possible they should be used.\n\nUnfortunately static arrays can only be used for sufficiently small arrays. After a certain size, they are forced to heap allocate after some instructions and their compile time balloons. Thus static arrays shouldn't be used if your system has more than 100 variables. Additionally, only the native Julia algorithms can fully utilize static arrays.\n\nLet's ***optimize `lorenz` using static arrays***.

        "Lastly, we can do other things like multithread the main loops, but these optimizations get the last 2x-3x out. The main optimizations which apply everywhere are the ones we just performed (though the last one only works if your matrix is a stencil. This is known as a matrix-free implementation of the PDE discretization).\n\nThis gets us to about 8x faster than our original MATLAB/SciPy/R vectorized style code!\n\nThe last thing to do is then ***optimize our algorithm choice***. We have been using `Tsit5()` as our test algorithm, but in reality this problem is a stiff PDE discretization and thus one recommendation is to use `CVODE_BDF()`. However, instead of using the default dense Jacobian, we should make use of the sparse Jacobian afforded by the problem. The Jacobian is the matrix $\\frac{df_i}{dr_j}$, where $r$ is read by the linear index (i.e. down columns). But since the $u$ variables depend on the $v$, the band size here is large, and thus this will not do well with a Banded Jacobian solver. Instead, we utilize sparse Jacobian algorithms. `CVODE_BDF` allows us to use a sparse Newton-Krylov solver by setting `linear_solver = :GMRES` (see [the solver documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/dev/solvers/ode_solve/#ode_solve_sundials-1), and thus we can solve this problem efficiently. Let's see how this scales as we increase the integration time."

        "Notice that we've elimated almost all allocations, allowing the code to grow without hitting garbage collection and slowing down.\n\nWhy is `CVODE_BDF` doing well? What's happening is that, because the problem is stiff, the number of steps required by the explicit Runge-Kutta method grows rapidly, whereas `CVODE_BDF` is taking large steps. Additionally, the `GMRES` linear solver form is quite an efficient way to solve the implicit system in this case. This is problem-dependent, and in many cases using a Krylov method effectively requires a preconditioner, so you need to play around with testing other algorithms and linear solvers to find out what works best with your problem.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJulia gives you the tools to optimize the solver \"all the way\", but you need to make use of it. The main thing to avoid is temporary allocations. For small systems, this is effectively done via static arrays. For large systems, this is done via in-place operations and cache arrays. Either way, the resulting solution can be immensely sped up over vectorized formulations by using these principles."
