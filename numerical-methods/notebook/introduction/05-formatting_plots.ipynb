In addition, there are special features specifically for [differential equation plots](https://docs.sciml.ai/dev/basics/plot/). This tutorial will teach some of the most commonly used options. Let's first get the solution to some ODE. Here I will use one of the Lorenz ordinary differential equation. As with all commands in DifferentialEquations.jl, I got a plot of the solution by calling `solve` on the problem, and `plot` on the solution:"
