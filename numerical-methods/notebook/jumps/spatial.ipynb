After the installation finishes, you will be able to use all the functionality described below.\n\n## Reversible binding model on a grid\n\nA 5 by 5 Cartesian grid:\n\n| <!-- -->  | <!-- -->  | <!-- -->  |  <!-- --> | <!-- -->  |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| . | . | . | . | B |\n| . | . | . | . | . |\n| . | . | . | . | . |\n| . | . | . | . | . |\n| A | . | . | . | . |\n\nSuppose we have a reversible binding system described by $$A+B \\to C$$ at rate $$k_1$$ and $$C \\to A+B$$ at rate $$k_2$$.

        "We can use either of the four versions of `hopping_constants` to construct a `JumpProblem` with the same syntax as in the original example. The different forms of hopping rates are supported not only for convenience but also for better memory usage and performance. So it is recommended that the most specialized form of hopping rates is used.\n\n### Solvers\n\nThere are currently two specialized \"spatial\" solvers: `NSM` and `DirectCRDirect`. The former stands for Next Subvolume Method [^1]. The latter employs Composition-Rejection to sample the next site to fire, similar to the ordinary DirectCR method. For larger networks `DirectCRDirect` is expected to be faster. Both methods can be used interchangeably.\n\nAdditionally, all standard solvers are supported as well, although they are expected to use more memory and be slower. They \"flatten\" the problem, i.e. turn all hops into reactions, resulting in a much larger system. For example, to use the Next Reaction Method (`NRM`), simply pass in `NRM()` instead of `NSM()` in the construction of the `JumpProblem`. Importantly, you *must* pass in `hopping_constants` in the `D_{s,i,j}` or `D_{s,i}` form to use any of the non-specialized solvers.\n\n## References\n[^1]: Elf, Johan and Ehrenberg, Mäns. “Spontaneous separation of bi-stable biochemical systems into spatial domains of opposite phases”.
