# Pattern Recognition

This directory contains:
- The homework from my PhD. course "Reconhecimento de PadrÃµes", taught by Guilherme de Alencar Barreto at UFC.
- This homework is essentially basic concept of pattern recognition and machine learning, which include:
    - Covariance and correlation matrix estimation
    - MAP classifier
    - Gaussian Naive Bayes (the so-called Classificadores Bayesianos Gaussianos) [1]
    - Ordinary Least Square (OLS) classifier [2,4]
    - Principal Component Analysis [3]
    - Clustering methods -> K-means [5]
- The compressed `.zip` file contains the code from colleges for the same course.
