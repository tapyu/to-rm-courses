# Adaptive filtering course at UFC

Professor: Charles Casimiro Cavalcante

- This [github repository][1] is a very good reference on how to implement adaptive filtering algorithms to be similar to Python machine learning packages, i.e., with the `fit()` and `predict()` methods.
- A more complete and professional Python package is the [`padasip`][2]. Nevertheless, its algorithm implementation, available on [github][3] page, can still be understandable. It uses [slightly different methods][4] than the previous repo. Some investigation is required to see which approach is the best one. It has a very [well-explained documentation][5] for each algorithm.

PS: The compressed `.zip` file contains the code from colleges for the same course.
