  abstract = {One of the main earth stations that INPE uses to track and control its satellites is located in the city of Cuiabá (15.33◦S, 56.46◦W, dip latitude, 6.1◦S), between the magnetic equator and the peak of the equatorial anomaly. Based on the GISM model, it is determined that the ionospheric scintillation index (S4) for the telemetry link in the S band (2 208 MHz) between Cuiabá station and the SCD2 satellite, depending on the date and time, can reach values greater than 0.8. This is the first study conducted on ionospheric S-band scintillation in this region of the earth. In this article, the channel model for the link and the telemetry receiver architecture are presented, in order to evaluate subsequently some of ionospheric scintillation effects on the functioning of the communication system. The modulation used is OQPSK and a fully-digital demodulator recovers the carrier phase using a Costas loop and synchronizes the symbols using a Gardner synchronizer. The design of OQPSK demodulator is detailed and the impact of ionospheric scintillation on general demodulator performance and on the functioning of its modules is discussed. The system bit error rate, the error variances of the carrier phase and symbol delay in different conditions of severity of ionospheric scintillation were figured out through computer simulation. From the presented results, it is evident that, for the adopted receiver architecture, which was designed for a space channel without scintillation, there is a substancial degradation on performance of the system even for S4 = 0.5 and, for the scenario where S4 = 0.8, the link becomes practically inoperative.},

  abstract = {This paper treats the problem of tracking the global navigation satellite system's (GNSS) signal phase under ionospheric scintillations and to generate an estimate of the scintillation phase and amplitude. In the case of ionospheric scintillations traditional phase locked loop (PLL) based GNSS receivers have problems to track the signal phase accurately. Moreover, these receivers do not estimate the scintillation phase and amplitude, which is evaluated in ionospheric monitoring applications. Therefore, Kalman filter based phase tracking algorithms have been proposed, which track line-of-sight (LOS) phase and scintillation amplitude and phase separately with different state space models. For modeling the scintillation phase and amplitude auto-regressive (AR) models can be used. In this case the parameters for the AR model have to be estimated together with the LOS and scintillation phase and amplitude. We propose to use a second Kalman filter for the estimation of the AR model parameters. This Kalman filter takes the scintillation phase and amplitude estimates from the first Kalman filter as measurement and the AR model parameters as system state. Simulation results for the global positioning system (GPS) show that the proposed algorithm achieves the same estimation performance for scintillation phase and amplitude as an algorithm with a priori knowledge on the AR model parameters.},

  abstract = {Naturally induced high altitude ionization will cause signal scintillation effects that are of great importance to the design and deployment of military satellite systems employing frequencies below 1 GHz. The scintillation will result in Rician or Rayleigh signal fading with finite signal decorrelation time and limited coherent bandwidth of the transmission channel.},

Unnikrishna Pillai of Polytechnic University. The book is intended for a senior/graduate level course in probability and is aimed at students in electrical engineering, math, and physics departments. The authors' approach is to develop the subject of probability theory and stochastic processes as a deductive discipline and to illustrate the theory with basic applications of engineering interest. Approximately 1/3 of the text is new material--this material maintains the style and spirit of previous editions. In order to bridge the gap between concepts and applications, a number of additional examples have been added for further clarity, as well as several new topics.},

The author then progresses to the key uses of digital design today, and how it is used to build high-performance alternatives to software.  Offers a fresh, up-to-date approach to digital design, whereas most literature available is sorely outdated Progresses though low levels of design, making a clear distinction between design and gate-level minimization Addresses the various uses of digital design today Enables you to gain a clearer understanding of applying digital design to your life  With this book by your side, you'll gain a better understanding of how to apply the material in the book to real-world scenarios.},
