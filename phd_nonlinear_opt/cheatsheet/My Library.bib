\par
For decades the theory of random phase screen was widely employed for interpretation of scintillation data. However, it is always the case that the parameters of the effective phase screen are chosen to better fit a given set of experimental data. The disadvantage of such a treatment is that the same parameters of the random screen cannot then be utilized for prediction of scintillation in different conditions of propagation.
\par
Brief explanation of GISM
\par
GISM model developed at IEEA uses the Multiple Phase Screen technique (MPS). It consists in a resolution of the Parabolic Equation (PE) for a medium divided into successive layers, each of them acting as a phase screen. It provides the statistical characteristics of the transmitted signals, in particular the scintillation index, the fade durations and the cumulative probability of the signal consequently allowing determination of the margins to be included in a budget link. Maps of the scintillation index S4 and of the phase standard deviation may also be obtained.

\par
more than 40\% of the year during the 20:00-02:00 local time period

Embedded systems represent target platforms that are usually specific to a single task. This specificity means the system design can be highly optimized because the range of tasks the device must perform is well bounded. In other words, you wouldn’t use your PC to run your coffee machine (you might, but that’s beside the point). Unlike your desktop processor, the 4-bit microcontroller that runs your coffee machine costs less than \$1 in large quantities. It does exactly what it’s supposed to do to — make your coffee.

Embedded systems failures due to failing to meet important timing deadlines are called hard real-time or time-critical failures. Likewise, poor performance can be attributed to soft real-time or time-sensitive failures.

A microprocessor is the CPU without any additional peripheral or support devices. Microcontrollers are designed to need a minimum complement of external parts.

  abstract = {One of the main earth stations that INPE uses to track and control its satellites is located in the city of Cuiabá (15.33◦S, 56.46◦W, dip latitude, 6.1◦S), between the magnetic equator and the peak of the equatorial anomaly. Based on the GISM model, it is determined that the ionospheric scintillation index (S4) for the telemetry link in the S band (2 208 MHz) between Cuiabá station and the SCD2 satellite, depending on the date and time, can reach values greater than 0.8. This is the first study conducted on ionospheric S-band scintillation in this region of the earth. In this article, the channel model for the link and the telemetry receiver architecture are presented, in order to evaluate subsequently some of ionospheric scintillation effects on the functioning of the communication system. The modulation used is OQPSK and a fully-digital demodulator recovers the carrier phase using a Costas loop and synchronizes the symbols using a Gardner synchronizer. The design of OQPSK demodulator is detailed and the impact of ionospheric scintillation on general demodulator performance and on the functioning of its modules is discussed. The system bit error rate, the error variances of the carrier phase and symbol delay in different conditions of severity of ionospheric scintillation were figured out through computer simulation. From the presented results, it is evident that, for the adopted receiver architecture, which was designed for a space channel without scintillation, there is a substancial degradation on performance of the system even for S4 = 0.5 and, for the scenario where S4 = 0.8, the link becomes practically inoperative.},

\par
First, the signal is acquired, providing a rough synchronization. Then, the tracking module refines the synchronization. These two modules are further described in the following.
\par
The first operation to be performed in a GNSS receiver when the signal has been digitized is signal acquisition, which means detecting the satellites in view.
\par
The tracking module of a GNSS receiver is in charge of refining and updating the coarse code-delay and Doppler shift estimates provided by the acquisition module. This is usually done by implementing two parallel closed-loop architectures in the ASIC, the so-called delay-lock loop (DLL) and phase-lock loop (PLL).
\par
antenna size
\par
Some of the methods available to reduce the antenna size (with a possible increase in weight and cost) include (1) loading the antenna with high permittivity and permeability materials such as substrates (e.g., ceramics); (2) adding capacitive and induc tive loads; (3) meandering and folding the printed circuit antennas; and (4) implementing shorting pins and slots.
\par
antenna size is not affected by the miniaturization
\par
Regarding the antenna size, in contrast with most HW components, this is not directly affected by semiconductor miniaturization, as the antenna size, in general, is directly proportional to the wavelength of the desired signal. In fact, the miniaturization of the antenna causes resonance at lower frequencies, reducing the radiation efficiency and the antenna bandwidth
\par
antennas and spatial filtering
\par
The antenna can also be considered a primary spatial filter. Actually, the antenna helps to elevate the signal-to-noise. ratio (SNR) of the line of sight (LOS) and allows the receiver to suppress undesired effects such as multipath, interference and spoofing attacks.
\par
applications
\par
Currently, global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are the favorite technology to provide positioning and timing capabilities in sectors such as surveying, remote sensing [5], object or animal tracking [6], and aviation [7]
\par
applications
\par
this trend is especially important where PVT solutions will be at the core of systems in which humans are out of the control loop, such as in communication network synchroniza tion, power grid monitoring, and autonomous vessels, cars or drones (urban air mobility)
\par
applications
\par
Some examples of such applications are autonomous driving [2] or civil aviation [7], automatic road user charging [20] or pay-per-use insurance [21], [22], and power grid monitoring [14] or stock trading operations [14], respectively
\par
applications and future prospects
\par
Positioning and timing information are expected to have a greater impact in the future with the advent of 5G/6G communications [1], autonomous driving [2], the Internet of Things (IoT) [3] and smart cities [4].
\par
applications and future prospects
\par
positioning is a key factor for many essential tasks in our modern society and will become even more important with the advent of new concepts such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities and autonomous driving.
\par
Even low-cost GNSS receivers can provide high-quality geodetic data that can be used in HA methods (PPP and RDK)
\par
Even the super-low-cost ASICs in mobile phones provide geodetic quality output data that can be used for HA methods such as real-time kinematics (RTK) and precise point positioning (PPP). Today, it is apparent that the antenna is the element that creates the difference between an MM and a professional receiver.
\par
future prospects = indoor positioning
\par
indoor positioning being one of the main challenges for today’s GNSS technology
\par
future prospects in antenna for GNSS
\par
In recent years, two different evolution trends have been identified: a single frequency GNSS antenna for low-power applications, and a multi-frequency antenna for MM applications without strict power constraints.
\par
The second evolution trend can be observed in MM receivers as a result of the increasing number of IoT applications requiring GNSS’s.
\par
To summarize the antenna evolution trend, in future years, triple-frequency antennas could be expected, not only in the professional and SCAp sectors but also in MM receivers without strict power constraints
\par
GNSS market segment: High precision and timing (Professional)
\par
Characterized by receivers designed to deliver the highest accuracy possible. Agriculture, geodesy, surveying, machine control, timing, and synchronization applica tions are all covered. The main target of the GNSS user technology in such applications is to obtain a PVT solution with the highest accuracy possible. In the last years, professional applications have also shown an interest on integrity PVT solutions for safety-of-life and capital-intensive applications, e.g., machine con trol or mining. In the professional segment, it is desired to achieve a cm-level accuracy.
\par
GNSS market segment: Mass-Market
\par
characterized by high-volume receivers for consumer devices. This includes appli cations such as automotive uses (not safety-critical), consumer drones, smartphones, augmented reality, and specialized IoT devices from mHealth to robotics. The key performance parameters (KPIs) of MM receivers are low-power consumption increasingly targeting more accurate solutions. Accuracy of the order of meters are considered. Then, MM receivers provide such levels of accuracy but with the lowest power consumption possible (between 1.5 to 200 mW). It is important to note that MM receivers target a short time to-first-fix (TTFF) ranging from a maximum of 30 s in a cold start to a maximum of 2 s for a hot start.
\par
GNSS market segment: Transport safety- and liability-critical (SCAp)
\par
characterized by receivers built in accordance with specific standards to deliver such solutions. Automotive, avia tion, professional drones, urban air mobility, maritime, search and rescue, and space-borne GNSS applications are all covered. The use of the PVT solution in such applications is diverse, but all of them use a GNSS user technology targeting high levels of integrity and robustness. This is translated into medium levels of accuracy between 2.5 - 10 m and 4 - 20 m the 95\% of the time for the horizontal and vertical planes, respectively. Integrity for safety-critical applications and robustness against multipath, unintentional interference, jamming and spoofing are all provided. In this case, the maxi mum TTFF is 120 s and 30 s for a cold and hot start, respectively.
\par
GNSS signals are spread-spectrum signals
\par
Oscillator noise impairments
\par
Oscillator instabilities can cause errors in these reference signals, thus limiting receiver performance in terms of both user position and time.
\par
Oscillator noise in GNSS systems
\par
The main operation to be carried out in the signal processing module is the correlation (see Fig. 3) of the input signal with a locally generated reference signal. As this is performed on a sample basis after the signal is digitized, the better the stability of the oscillator is, the longer the integration time that can be used for the correlation. Long integration times are specially required in HS or indoor scenarios, and therefore, oscillator noise is an important factor to be considered in an RF-FE since it limits the sensitivity and accuracy of the PVT solution [37].
\par
PPP, RTK, and stand alone are PVT computation methods for HA applications 
\par
Different PVT computation options can be identified, such as stand-alone, RTK/PPP or sensor fusion.
\par
RF-FE general architecture
\par
After the antenna, the signal is processed by an RF-FE, which is composed of a low noise amplifier (LNA), an RF filter, a local oscillator, a mixer, and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC);
\par
RF-FE has no big prospection
\par
No large changes are expected in RF-FEs, including the addition of more RF-FEs within a receiver to cope with the expected increase in available frequency bands by the signal processing unit, e.g., ASICs.
\par
Satellite Navigation Systems (GPS, GLONASS, Baidu, etc)
\par
In parallel with semiconductor technology, GNSSs have also experienced unprecedented growth in terms of both adoption and evolution of the technology since its origin. The first GNSS was the well-known Global Positioning System (GPS), developed during the early 1970s by the U.S. govern ment and declared fully operational in 1995 [9]. The Russian system GLONASS was developed almost at the same time and was also fully operational by 1995 [10], [11]. Today, the European Galileo system and the Chinese BeiDou are also available for use [11]. India and Japan have also developed regional standalone (NavIC and QZSS, respectively) or aug mentation systems [11]. The implementation of all these sys tems allow receivers to use satellites from different systems to compute the user position, namely multi-GNSS, and this is an additional key driving force for the popularization of GNSS. These systems provide the satellite constellation and ground segment equipment needed to control the proper behavior of the system that allow the user to obtain its position, velocity and time (PVT) solution.
\par
The ASICs provide the pseudorange to the uP, which in turn computes the PVT solution
\par
the signal processing part carried out by the ASIC provides the pseudoranges to the PVT module.
\par
The necessity of high synchronization for GNSS receivers
\par
From a signal processing point of view, GNSS receivers perform a very accurate synchronization. The synchronization required in a GNSS receiver is much higher than the synchronization required in communication systems, as 1 µs of error is translated into a ranging error of almost 300 m.
\par
the oscillator provides the reference timing to the ADC
\par
the oscillator provides the reference timing to the ADC to perform the sampling of the incoming signal during the digitization phase.
\par
The standard tracking module consists in PLL+DLL
\par
This is usually done by implementing two parallel closed-loop architectures in the ASIC, the so-called delay-lock loop (DLL) and phase-lock loop (PLL).
\par
For applications in which less precision but more robustness is required, the PLL is replaced with a frequency-lock loop (FLL).
\par
traditional GNSS receivers
\par
For the PVT computation, traditional GNSS receivers have used first an analog processing to capture and digitize the GNSS signals. Second, the digital processing of the receiver identified the different satellites in view and extracted the information needed for the PVT computation. This has traditionally been done by the so-called acquisition and tracking module of the receiver. Then, the PVT computation module obtains the user solution given by 4 parameters: the user’s 3D position coordinates and GNSS time [10]. This is why the acquisition and tracking modules are repeated for every satellite in view, usually at least four satellites. An overview of this architecture is given in Fig. 1.

In analog-implemented modems, synchronization typically is performed ~by a feedback loop that adjusts the phase of a local clock, or ~by a feedforward arrangement that regenerates a timing wave ~from the incoming signal.

Implementation of the modem by digital techniques (a topic of intense present activity) introduces sampling of the signal.

  abstract = {This paper treats the problem of tracking the global navigation satellite system's (GNSS) signal phase under ionospheric scintillations and to generate an estimate of the scintillation phase and amplitude. In the case of ionospheric scintillations traditional phase locked loop (PLL) based GNSS receivers have problems to track the signal phase accurately. Moreover, these receivers do not estimate the scintillation phase and amplitude, which is evaluated in ionospheric monitoring applications. Therefore, Kalman filter based phase tracking algorithms have been proposed, which track line-of-sight (LOS) phase and scintillation amplitude and phase separately with different state space models. For modeling the scintillation phase and amplitude auto-regressive (AR) models can be used. In this case the parameters for the AR model have to be estimated together with the LOS and scintillation phase and amplitude. We propose to use a second Kalman filter for the estimation of the AR model parameters. This Kalman filter takes the scintillation phase and amplitude estimates from the first Kalman filter as measurement and the AR model parameters as system state. Simulation results for the global positioning system (GPS) show that the proposed algorithm achieves the same estimation performance for scintillation phase and amplitude as an algorithm with a priori knowledge on the AR model parameters.},

Also, a frequency locked loop (FLL) can be used to assist the PLL to maintain signal lock when the signal amplitude is small and a pure PLL structure would loose lock [1], [4].
\par
GNSS signals can be used to track ionospheric scintillation
\par
On the other hand the ionospheric effect on the signal can be used to trace back from the measured signal perturbations on the structure of the ionosphere. The GNSS receiver, in this case, acts as an ionospheric monitor which uses probes from different satellites at different points of the ionosphere.
\par
GNSSs usually operate in low SNR
\par
Due to the typical distance between GNSS satellite and receiver, the received signal power and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are low.

Scintillation amplitude=Nakagami distribution 
\par
scintillation amplitude γS[k] follows a temporally correlated Nakagami-m distribution2 [22].
\par
Scintillation phase=Gaussian distribution
\par
scintillation phases φS[k] follow a zero mean temporally correlated Gaussian process [21]

The PSD of the scintillation signal has a lowpass behavior
\par
Motivated by the low-pass characteristic of the power spectral density (PSD) of scintillation amplitude and phase
\par
The trade-off of the loop bandwidth of PLL/DLL
\par
To maintain lock under ionospheric scintillations PLL/ DLL tracking loop structure the PLL noise bandwidth can be adopted [1]. The noise bandwidth should be wide, to track rapidly changing carrier phases. In contrast, to tolerate amplitude scintillation and track signals with small amplitude the noise bandwidth should be chosen narrow.
\par
Tradutional tracking modules (PLL+DLL) cannot withstand to ionospheric scintillation
\par
In the case of ionospheric scintillations traditional phase locked loop (PLL) based GNSS receivers have problems to track the signal phase accurately.
\par
The GNSS signal is commonly tracked by a closedloop phase locked-loop (PLL) and delay locked-loop (DLL). If the signal phase or amplitude shows deep fades due to ionospheric scintillations, the PLL may not be able to follow the signal phase and therefore go into a non-linear state or loose lock. In this case the tracked signal phase and amplitude is not purely representative of the line-of-sight (LOS) and scintillation effect but also includes non-linear receiver effects. This affects the receiver’s positioning as well as ionospheric monitoring capabilities.

Usually not all vissible satellites are affected by ionospheric scintillations}

The position solution is calculated from code phase or carrier phase estimates of the GNSS signal, which requires for a continuous tracking of both signal parameters.
\par
code delay, carrier phase and Doppler frequency are determined by the relative movement of satellite and receiver
\par
FLL can be used to improve the PLL performance under ionospheric scintillation
\par
For GNSS receivers with a state-of-the-art PLL/ DLL structure different methods have been investigated to harden the tracking loops against ionospheric scintillations, e.g., tuning the loop noise bandwidth [11], adaptive loop noise bandwidths [12, 13] or using a frequency locked loop (FLL) to assist the PLL to maintain signal lock when the signal amplitude is small and a simple PLL structure would loose lock [11, 14].

GNSS are CDMA systems
\par
To account for the long channel distance and therefore low received SNR, GNSS satellites transmit code division multiple access (CDMA) signals c(t) ∈ R on different carrier frequencies fc ∈ R.

How to treat quantization in communication systems
\par
In the following the number of bits for the quantization is assumed to be sufficiently large, such that all effects of interest are captured by the digital resolution of the signal and no additional errors are introduced by quantization
\par
Ionospheric scintillation cause diffraction and refraction on the electromagnetic wave
\par
These irregularities lead to diffraction or refraction of the electromagnetic wave travelling through the ionosphere
\par
ML structures can be used in case of static receivers
\par
In case of static receivers, e.g., for monitoring stations, also so-called open loop or maximum likelihood (ML) structures [16, 17] become feasible [18]. In this case the estimation with the ML principle can be assisted with the known position which decreases the computational effort.
\par
The two-step approach (RF-IF-BB) the implemented by many state-of-art receivers
\par
two step approach with analogue conversion to an intermediate frequency followed by a conversion to baseband and downsampling in the digital domain has been discussed. In this work we follow the latter approach, which is implemented in many state of the art receivers.
\par
Three parts of the GNSS channel:sat-ionosphere, ionosphere, ionosphere-receiver
\par
The transmit channel can be divided into three parts. The first part covers the medium between the satellite and the top of the ionosphere. The second part covers the ionosphere, while the third part stretches from the lower border of the ionosphere to the receiver.
\par
γ0(t) depends mainly on the distance and frequency of the carrier
\par
signal path coefficient mainly depends on the signal frequency and the distance between satellite and receiver. The signal path coefficient decreases with increasing distance between satellite and receiver. The distance between satellite and receiver in general decreases when the satellite approaches the zenith.}

To calculate the values of these two indices, the measurements acquired from the receiver must be detrended to remove the low-frequency contributions from satellite-receiver range variations, antenna patterns, background ionosphere, troposphere delays, and receiver and satellite oscillator drifts etc.
\par
The conventional method is to apply a 6th order Butterworth filter with a 0.1 Hz cut-off frequency.
\par
Pull-in range, acquisition range, or capture range

The range of sigma phi is defined by the receiver’s carrier tracking pull-in range. For scintillation that results in phase fluctuations beyond such a range, the receiver has a high probability of losing lock of the signal. At that point, the value of sigma phi carries

\par
GNSS receivers are more subject to phase errors, cycle slips, increased carrier Doppler jitter, and losses of lock, resulting in positioning errors of the order of tens of meters, and, in the most severe cases, even in the complete receiver outage
\par
GNSS is not restricted to positioning
\par
GNSSs are not limited to positioning purposes, but span an unlimited range of applications, including scientific observations.
\par
Hard, semi-hard, and manual detection
\par
1) Hard Detection: A hard detection rule is defined by simply applying the threshold TS4 on the estimated value of S4.
\par
2) Semihard Detection: In order to better characterize the scintillation phenomenon and to reduce the false alarm rate, more filters can be applied to the signal.
\par
3) Manual Detection: A “third” approach corresponds to human-driven manual and subjective identification of the portion of data affected by scintillation.
\par
Manual detection is not suitable to quasireal-time detection
\par
Manual annotation can assure higher accuracy in the event classification, in terms of duration and continuity, at the expenses of a time-consuming human-driven visual inspection. Furthermore, it is a post-processing analysis that is not suitable for a quasi-real-time detection.
\par
manual detection is the ground truth for detection performance
\par
the manual annotation is considered as the reference ground truth for the detection performance analysis. The same approach has been used also in other works relying on machine learning for scintillation detection [17],[18].
\par
other phenomena that is confused with scintillation
\par
can be misleading, due to: the loss of the transient phases of the events, causing a delay in the raise of possible warning flags; the missed detection of weak events with high variance; or the signal distortions caused by other phenomena, such as multipath.
\par
Scintillation is a quasi-random process
\par
Occurrence of scintillation is very difficult to be modeled, due to their quasi-random nature [22]. 
\par
Threshold values commonly used for GNSS applications
\par
The threshold is commonly assumed to be TS4 = 0.4 by Dubey et al. in [31]–[35]; other works consider scintillation moderate in the range between 0.2 and 0.5, and strong above 0.5 [36].}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
we implicitly assumed that the channel characteristics, either the impulse response or the frequency response, were known at the receiver. However, in most communication systems that employ equalizers, the channel characteristics are unknown a priori and, in many cases, the channel response is time-variant. In such a case, the equalizers are designed to be adjustable to the channel response and, for time-variant channels, to be adaptive to the time variations in the channel response.

Chi-Square (χ2) Random Variable
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
If \{Xₖ , k = 1,..., n\} are iid (independent and identically distributed) zero-mean Gaussian random variables with common variance σ2 and we define then X = ∑\{i=1\}\^n Xₖ² is a χ2 random variable with n degrees of freedom.

\par
interest. This is the PDF of an exponential random variable with mean equal to 2σ2

Fading channels: Doppler spread, coherence time
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Channels having randomly time variant impulse responses. This characterization serves as a model for signal transmission over many radio channels

\item 
the reciprocal of Bd (Doppler spread) is a measure of the coherence time of the channel.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
The range of values of λ over which SC(λ) (Doppler power spectrum) is essentially nonzero is called the Doppler spread Bd of the channel.

\item 
The rapidity of the fading on the frequency-nonselective channel is determined either from the correlation function RC(Δt) or from the Doppler power spectrum SC(λ). Alternatively, either of the channel parameters (Δt)c or Bd can be used to characterize the rapidity of the fading.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
A slowly changing channel has a large coherence time or, equivalently, a small Doppler spread.

\item 
Since T is smaller than the coherence time of the channel, the channel attenuation and phase shift are essentially fixed for the duration of at least one signaling interval. When this condition holds, we call the channel a slowly fading channel.

\item 
the condition that the channel fades slowly implies that the multiplicative process may be regarded as a constant during at least one signaling interval

\end{itemize}

\par
Fading vs. frequency-selective channels: spread factor
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
It should be emphasized that the frequency selectivity and fading are viewed as two different types of distortion.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Additional distortion is caused by the time variations in C( f; t). This type of distortion is evidenced as a variation in the received signal strength, and has been termed fading.

\item 
When W ≈ 1/T, the conditions that the channel be frequency-nonselective and slowly fading imply that the product of Tm and Bd must satisfy the condition TmBd {$<$} 1. The product TmBd is called the spread factor of the channel. If TmBd {$<$} 1, the channel is said to be underspread; otherwise, it is overspread.

\item 
it is possible to select the signal sl (t) such that these channels are frequency-nonselective and slowly fading

\end{itemize}

\par
Frequency-selective channels: Multipath spread, coherence bandwidth
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
The range of values of τ over which Rc(τ) (multipath intensity profile) is essentially nonzero is called the multipath spread of the channel and is denoted by Tm.

\item 
If we select the signaling interval T to satisfy the condition T {$>>$} Tm, the channel introduces a negligible amount of intersymbol interference.

\item 
Since RC(Δf) (frequency-spaced correlation function) is an autocorrelation function in the frequency variable, it provides us with a measure of the frequency coherence of the channel.

\item 
if (Δf)c is small in comparison to the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, the channel is said to be frequency-selective. In this case, the signal is severely distorted by the channel. On the other hand, if (Δf)c is large in comparison with the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, the channel is said to be frequency-nonselective.

\item 
If Sl(f) has a bandwidth W greater than the coherence bandwidth (Δf)c of the channel, Sl(f) is subjected to different gains and phase shifts across the band. In such a case, the channel is said to be frequency-selective.

\item 
The signal bandwidth W is much smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. Hence, the channel is frequency-nonselective. In other words, all the frequency components in Sl(f) undergo the same attenuation and phase shift in transmission through the channel. But this implies that, within the bandwidth occupied by Sl (f), the time-variant transfer function C(f; t) of the channel is a complex-valued constant in the frequency variable. Since Sl(f) has its frequency content concentrated in the vicinity of f = 0, C(f; t) = C(0; t). Thus, when the signal bandwidth W is much smaller than the coherence bandwidth (Δf)c of the channel, the received signal is simply the transmitted signal multiplied by a complex-valued random process C(0; t), which represents the time-variant characteristics of the channel. In this case, we say that the multipath components in the received are not resolvable because W {$<<$} (Δf)c.

\item 
frequency-selective channel can be modeled as a tapped delay line (transversal) filter with time-variant tap coefficients

\end{itemize}

\par
Many multipaths fading channel -{$>$} Central limit theorem -{$>$} Gaussian random process
\par
When there are a large number of paths, the central limit theorem can be applied. That is, rl (t) may be modeled as a complex-valued Gaussian random process. This means that the time-variant impulse response c(τ; t) is a complex-valued Gaussian random process in the t variable.

\item 
An alternative statistical model for the Rayleigh distribution

\begin{itemize}

\item 
is a two-parameter distribution, involving the parameter m and the second moment = E(R2).

\item 
provides more flexibility and accuracy in matching the observed signal statistics.

\item 
it includes the Rayleigh distribution as a special case (m = 1).

\item 

\par
For values of m in the range 1/2 ≤ m ≤ 1, we obtain PDFs that have larger tails than a
\par
Rayleigh-distributed random variable. 
\par
\item 
For values of m {$>$} 1, the tail of the PDF decays faster than that of the Rayleigh.

\end{itemize}

\par
Rayleigh random variable
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
When there are a large number of paths, the central limit theorem can be applied. That is, rl (t) may be modeled as a complex-valued Gaussian random process. This means that the time-variant impulse response c(τ; t) is a complex-valued Gaussian random process in the t variable.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
When the impulse response c(τ; t) is modeled aa zero-mean complex-valued Gaussian process, the envelope |c(τ; t)| at any instant t is Rayleigh-distributed. In this case the channel is said to be a Rayleigh fading channel. In the event that there are fixed scatterers or signal reflectors in the medium, in addition to randomly moving scatterers, c(τ; t) can no longer be modeled as having zero-mean. In this case, the envelope |c(τ; t)| has a Rice distribution and the channel is said to be a Ricean fading channel.

\item 
Rayleigh distribution is characterized by the single parameter E(R2).

\item 
A generalized version of the Rayleigh random variable is obtained when we have n iid zero-mean Gaussian random variables \{Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n\} where each Xi has an N(0,σ2) distribution

\item 
Rayleigh random variable is the square root of a χ2 random variable with two degrees of freedom. We can also conclude that the Rayleigh random variable is the square root of an exponential random variable as given by Equation 2.3–27.

\item 
A generalized version of the Rayleigh random variable is obtained when we have n iid zero-mean Gaussian random variables \{Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n\} where each Xi has an N(0,σ2) distribution.

Rice random variable
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
If X1 and X2 are two independent Gaussian random variables distributed according to N(m1,σ2) andN(m2,σ2) (i.e., the variances are equal and the meansmaybe different). Then X=

\item 
Ricean random variable is the square root of a noncentral χ2 random variable with two degrees of freedom.

\item 
The Rice distribution is a two-parameter distribution. It may be expressed by the PDF given in Equation 2.3–56, where the parameters are s and σ2, where s2 is called the noncentrality parameter in the equivalent chi-square distribution. It represents the power in the nonfading signal components, sometimes called specular components,of the received signal

\item 
a generalized Ricean random variable can be defined as X =

\end{itemize}

\par
Spread spectrum signals, bandwidth expansion factor, CDMA
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
their bandwidth W is much greater than the information rate R in bits/s.

\item 
bandwidth expansion factor Be =W/R for a spread spectrum signal is much greater than unity

\item 
The large redundancy inherent in spread spectrum signals is required to overcome the severe levels of interference that are encountered in the transmission of digital information over some radio and satellite channels

\item 
Since coded waveforms are also characterized by a bandwidth expansion factor greater than unity and since coding is an efficient method for introducing redundancy, it follows that coding is an important element in the design of spread spectrum signals and systems.

\item 
In applications other than communications, spread spectrum signals are used to obtain accurate range (time delay) and range rate (velocity) measurements in radar and navigation.

\item 
the transmitted signals in this common spectrum may be distinguished from one another by superimposing a different pseudorandom pattern, also called a code, in each transmitted signal. Thus, a particular receiver can recover the transmitted information intended for it by knowing the pseudorandom pattern, i.e., the key, used by the corresponding transmitter. This type of communication technique, which allows multiple users to simultaneously use a common channel for transmission of information, is called code division multiple access (CDMA).

\item 
It has a low probability of being intercepted (detected) by a casual listener and, hence, is also called a lowprobability-of-intercept (LPI) signal.

\item 
It has a low probability of being intercepted (detected) by a casual listener and, hence, is also called a lowprobability-of-intercept (LPI) signal. message privacy may be obtained by superimposing a pseudorandom pattern on a transmitted message. The message can be demodulated by the intended receivers, who know the pseudorandom pattern or key used at the transmitter, but not by any other receivers who do not have knowledge of the key.

\end{itemize}

\par
The constructive/destructive effect due to fading channels
\par
The fading phenomenon is primarily a result of the time variations in the phases \{θn(t)\}. That is, the randomly time variant phases \{θn(t)\} associated with the vectors \{αn ejθn\} at times result in the vectors adding destructively. When that occurs, the resultant received signal rl (t) is very small or practically zero. At other times, the vectors \{αn ejθn\} add constructively, so that the received signal is large. Thus, the amplitude variations in the received signal, termed signal fading, are due to the time-variant multipath characteristics of the channel.
\par
Uncorrelated scattering
\par
In most radio transmission media, the attentuation and phase shift of the channel associated with path delay τ1 is uncorrelated with the attenuation and phase shift associated with path delay τ2. This is usually called uncorrelated scattering.}

\par
Adaptive filtering belongs to the realm of learning algorithms, so widely used in our daily life when we hear about machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, etc. However, the first concepts related to this field have a long history [1] and might be attributed to the German mathematician Gauss [2]. The early 1960s witnessed some breakthroughs [3], whereas we are presently living in the age of learning from data [4].
\par
The standard procedures of constructing an adaptive filtering algorithm resemble those utilized in machine learning [4] in the sense that they consist of a model, represented here by the adaptive filter structure; the cost function is called here objective function; and by the learning or optimization algorithm, more often referred in this book as minimization algorithm. In most adaptive filtering configurations, there is a reference signal which is inherent to the case of supervised learning in machine learning literature, whereas the blind adaptive filtering cases fall in the unsupervised learning category. The classical adaptive filtering literature describes procedures to minimize objective functions whose models are mostly linear, or relatively simple, on the parameters and utilize a wide range of learning algorithms, while aiming to process signals acquired online and possibly implemented on embedded systems. As a rule, machine learning algorithms utilize more sophisticated structures and cost functions whose minimization can be achieved using numerical optimization whenever a gradient approximation is available. Learning from data in machine learning requires a large amount of data classified in training data, consisting of labeled data for training the network, and test data to evaluate how the trained network generalizes (represents) well for data not belonging to the training set. Classical machine learning algorithms are very successful in some applications but fail in some artificial intelligence tasks such as speech and object recognition, since these applications have high dimension and are better represented through a composition of features configured in networks consisting of several layers, see Chap. 11, unlike the typical adaptive filtering configuration containing an input and an output layer [31]. The learning systems with multiple layers, inspired by the multilayer perceptron, are collectively called deep learning and are subject of intensive research.}

  note = {A distinct aspect of the GNSS signals are the modulation of the carrier with a PRN code
\par
A distinct feature of all GNSS signals is the modulation of the harmonic radio wave (termed the carrier) with a characteristic pseudorandom noise (PRN) code
\par
Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation for generation of legacy GPS signals
\par
Both legacy GPS signals are generated using direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation, illustrated in Fig. 7.7. A DSSS signal may be formed as the product of three components:
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
A radio frequency (RF) carrier

\item 
A data waveform

\item 
A spreading waveform.

\end{enumerate}

\par
Encrypted P-code is called Y-code. Either mode is commonly referred to as P(Y)-code
\par
The P-code signal is only intended for authorized (military) use and is normally encrypted. When the P-code is in this encrypted mode of operation, it is formally referred to as the Y-code. In either mode of operation, the signal is most commonly referred to as the P(Y)-code.
\par
GNSS receivers can distinguish a sat among all others by the ranging code within the PRN code 
\par
In most GNSSs, the PRN sequence also serves as a unique fingerprint, which allows the receiver to distinguish individual satellites transmitting on the same frequency. The PRN code is continuously repeated at intervals of a few milliseconds to seconds and facilitates measurements of the signal transmission time.
\par
GNSS signals are electromagnetic waves propagating at the speed of light in the L band
\par
GNSS signals are electromagnetic waves propagating at the speed of light. Signal frequencies in the radio spectrum between about 1:2and 1:6 GHz (a part of the so-called L-band)
\par
How satellite-based positioning systems worked vs. How they work
\par
By measuring the Doppler frequency shift of the 20MHz radio signals received from the satellite at a known location, the orbit of the satellite could be worked out.
\par
These new systems were based on the concept of range measurements rather than Doppler observations and used a different constellation design offering continuous coverage.
\par
L1 or L2 M-code -{$>$} ~new military signals; L1C or L2C -{$>$} new military signals
\par
a new military signal on L1 and L2 referred to as the M code [7.35], and a new civil signal on L2 referred to as L2C
\par
L5 is for civil applications
\par
introduced a third civil signal on a new carrier frequency. Both the carrier and the signal are referred to as L5
\par
Legacy GPS signals: L1 C/A, and L1 and L2 P-code
\par
The oldest 15 of the 31 operational satellites, comprising Block IIA and IIR vehicles launched up through 2004, only broadcast what are now referred to as the legacy GPS signals. The legacy GPS signals include the coarse/acquisition- (C/A-) code signal on the link 1 (L1). carrier frequency of 1575:42MHz and the precision- (P-) code signal on both L1 and the link 2 (L2) frequency of 1227:6MHz
\par
Navigation data/message = ephemeris data + GNSS system time
\par
On top of the ranging code, the signal is also modulated with a low rate (e.g., 50 bits=s) navigation data stream (known as the broadcast navigation message) that provides information on the orbit of the transmitting satellite and the offset of its local clock from the GNSS system time.
\par
Reason of the necessity of 4 (or more) in-view sats
\par
We thus need at least four simultaneous pseudoranges to estimate the three receiver coordinates and the receiver clock offset.
\par
What if signals from more than four satellites are available? Because of the unmodeled errors (e.g., atmospheric delays) as well as the residual errors in the modeled terms, it is beneficial to use simultaneous pseudoranges to all m available satellites for estimating the receiver coordinates and clock offset.
\par
Space, control, and user segments
\par
GNSSs and regional navigation satellite systems (RNSSs) commonly consist of three components:
\par
1-  The space segment comprises a constellation of satellites orbiting above the Earth’s surface that transmit ranging signals on at least two frequencies in the microwave part of the radio spectrum.
\par
2- The control segment is responsible for maintaining the health of the system bymonitoring the broadcast signals and computing and uploading to the satellites required navigation data. It consists of a group of globally (or locally)-dispersed monitoring stations, ground antennas for communicating with the satellites, and a master control station with a backup facility at a different location.
\par
3- The user segment consists of GNSS receiving equipment both civil and military. This includes receivers on the ground, at sea, in the air, and even in space.
\par
The basic outputs from the ASICs, computed by the acquisition and tracking modules
\par
Pseudorange: A measure of the difference between the receiver clock at signal reception and the satellite clock at signal transmission (scaled by the speed of light). Except for the asychronicity of the two clocks and some other delays, the pseudorange measures the satellite–receiver distance, the precision of which is in the dm-range. 
\par
Carrier phase: A measure of the instantaneous beat phase and the accumulated number of zero-crossings obtained after mixing with a reference signal of the nominal frequency. Changes in carrier phase over time reflect the change in (pseudo)range but are substantially ( 2 orders) more precise. In case of interrupted tracking the accumulated cycle count is lost and the carrier-phase measurements exhibit a cycle slip. PS: Friederike Fohlmeister in "Dual Kalman Filtering based GNSS Phase Tracking for Scintillation Mitigation" calls carrier phase as LOS (line of sight) phase
\par
Doppler: The change in the received frequency caused by the Doppler effect is a measure of the range-rate or line-of-sight velocity.
\par
They are complemented by information on the orbit and clock offsets of the individual GNSS satellites, which is transmitted as part of the broadcast navigation message and allows the receiver to compute the position and velocity of the transmitting satellite at the signal transmission time.
\par
The C/A-code is open (unencrypted)
\par
The fundamental computation of the GNSS is the propagation delay, which is calculated from the PRN code
\par
The basic measurement made by a GNSS receiver is the time   required for the GNSS signal to propagate from a satellite to the receiver. This can be obtained by tracking the PRN code modulation of the signal. Within the receiver, a local copy of the PRN sequence is generated, which is continuously compared and aligned with the signal received from the satellite.
\par
By comparing this time with the local receiver time, the signal propagation time, and – upon multiplication by the speed of light – the distance or range from receiver to satellite are obtained.
\par
The PRN code rate is high correlated with the quality of the geodetic data
\par
This code is essentially a binary sequence of zeros and ones with no obvious pattern or regularity. The sequence is transmitted at a rate of typically 1−10MHz, where higher rates imply a higher processing effort but promise more precise measurements.
\par
The satellite clock are monitored by GNSS operations, and its corrections are sent in the navigation message to the receiver adjust it
\par
The GNSS operators monitor the satellite clocks and determine the offsets and drifts with respect to system time. These parameters are subsequently uploaded to the satellites and transmitted as part of a navigation message broadcast by the satellites. A GNSS receiver uses these satellite clock offset values to correct the measured pseudoranges. However, we then still have the receiver clock error to deal with.
\par
From the chatgpt:
\par
The GNSS operators in this sentence refer to organizations or entities responsible for operating and maintaining the GNSS system, such as government agencies or private companies. They are responsible for monitoring the timekeeping systems on the GNSS satellites, determining any offsets or drifts, and uploading the necessary correction information to the satellites to be transmitted in the navigation message broadcast.
\par
Tracking loop: continuous measurements of the code phase and transmission delay time
\par
This tracking loop provides continuous measurements of the instantaneous code phase and hence the transmission time corresponding to the currently received signal
\par
Why it is called pseudorange
\par
So far we assumed that the clock in the GNSS receiver was synchronized with the clocks in the satellites. This assumption, however, is fallacious. When a GNSS receiver is switched on, its clock will in general be missynchronized with respect to the satellite clocks, by an unknown amount. Furthermore, the clocks in the satellites are synchronized with each other and to a master time scale, called the system time, only to within about a millisecond. The range measurements the receiver makes are biased by the receiver and satellite clock errors, dtr and dts, and are therefore referred to as pseudoranges}

Two regimes may be identified. For values of the amplitude scintillation index (S4) below approximately 0.5, the RMS value of phase and intensity fluctuations seems to be linearly correlated and approximately equal.

  note = {Application specific microprocessors
\par
And technology trends have led to the situation of designers being able to create semi-custom processors ("application-specific" processors) that have just the right architecture for one or a small number of applications, making knowledge of programmable processor designs important.
\par
MY WORDS: 
\par
ASIC
\par
Because physical implementation on full-custom ICs is so costly and time-consuming, semicustom IC types evolved during the 1980s and 1990s to reduce tile costs and the time of fabricating a chip. These types are known as application-specific i11tegrated circu its, or ASICs. Two common ASIC types are standard cell and gate array.
\par
Cell-based ASICs
\par
Standard cell is an ASIC type that reduces physical implementation NRE cost and manufacturing time compared to full-custom ICs. Standard cell ASICs, sometimes called cellbased AS/Cs, use a collection (known as a library ) of previously layed-out gates or pieces of logic, called cells, that must be instantiated and connected with wires to implement a circujt. A cell might be a 2-in
\par
Control unit
\par
Thus, the basic parts of the control unit include the program counter PC, the instruction register IR, and a controller.
\par
FPGA = control logic blocs (CLB) + switch matrices
\par
The two basic types of components inside an FPGA are lookup tables and switch matrices.
\par
FPGA alongside microprocessors
\par
computer makers today increasingly provide support for adding FPGAsalongside microprocessors, and thus many desktop computers, server computers, andsupercomputers today come with hardware and software support for FPGAs. Furthermore, new compilers exist that can translate high-level progrnm code like C++ code intocircuits on FPGAs.
\par
FPGA vs. Microprocessors
\par
With a variety of microprocessors readily available, why wouldanyone ever neer1 to design new digital circuits, other than those relatively few people designing microprocessor digital circuits themselves? The reason is that software running on a microprocessor isn't always goodenough for a particular application. In many cases. software may be too s low. Microproce\textasciitilde son; only execute one instruction or a few instructions at a time . But a custom digital circujt can execute hundreds or thousands of computations in parallel. Many applications. like picnue or video compression, face recognjdon, voice command detection, or graphics display, require huge nurnben; of computations to be done in a short period of time in order to be practical- after au, who wa11ts a voice-controlled phone tbacrequires 5 minutes co decode your voice command. or a digital camera that requires 15 minutes to take each picture? In other cases, microprocessors are too big, or consume too much power, or would be too costly, thus making custom digital circuits preferable.
\par
FPGAs are also viewed as an alternative to microprocessors in computing platfonns. ln particulru-, some computations can be performed faster on an FPGAthan on a microprocessor. For example, multiplying 20 pairs of 4-bit numbers mightrequire about 200 clock cycles on a microprocessor, as each multiplication requiresinstructions to fetch, multiply, and store the data and those instructions execute (mostly)sequentially. However, multiplying those 20 pairs of numbers could require just one clockcycle on an FPGA if the FPGA had capacity for 20 multipliers- all 20 multiplicationscould be done in parallel. Even if the FPGA clock cycle were 10 times slower than themicroprocessor's clock cycle, the net result would still be a 20x speedup ((20011)/10) onthe FPGA.
\par
FPGAs have no gate arrays!
\par
Field-programmable gate ~(FPGAs) have no "gate arrays " inside them- the name is there due to historical reasons
\par
Gate arrays ASICs
\par
A gate array ASIC involves a chip whose transistorsare predesigned to form rows("atTays") of logic gates on the chip. only the wires remain to be fabricated. ~Creating the wires represents just the last steps of fabrication, and thus gatearray technology eliminates muchof the time and cost of fabricatinga chip for a particular circuit. Compared to standard cell (also called cell-based) ~ASICs, gate anay ASICs involve less NRE and requireless time. However, gate array ASICs are less optimized.
\par
In the 2000s, the term structured ASIC began to replace the term "gate array" inpractice. A structured ASIC usually supplements arrays of gates with other componentson the chip, such as microprocessors, RAMs, and other higher-level system buildingblocks. The term platform ASIC is also sometimes used.
\par
High-level state machine (HLSM) vs. Finite State Machine (FSM)
\par
high-level state machine (HLSM) whose inputs, outputs, state actions, and transition conditions can all involve higher-level data types like binary numbers or integers rather than just the Boolean type used in FSMs.
\par
instruction set
\par
The way instructions are represented in the instruction memory, and the list of allowable instructions, are known as a programmable processor's instruction set. 
\par
Latches vs. Flip-Flops
\par
Various textbooks define the te11ns latch and flip-flop differently. We'll use what seems to be the most common convention among designers, namely:
\par
• A latch is level-sensitive, and
\par
• A flip-flop is edge-triggered
\par
Mapping, placement, routing, and physical design
\par
The task of conve1ting a desired digital circuit into a circuit using only components from a particular library (e.g., a particular standard cell library) is known as technology mapping. The task of detem1ining where to place those components on a chip is known as placemellt, and the task of connecting those components by wires is known as routing. All three tasks are collectively known as physical design, and are typically carried out today by automated tools.
\par
Microprocessor vs. Custom (or single-purpose) processor design via RTL
\par
The name processor is best known from its use in the name microprocessor. A microprocessor is a programmable processor, which is a general predesigned processor created to carry out any desired computation \{see Chapter 8). This chapter instead focuses on designing custom processors, which are processors each of whose design is specialized to implement one specific computation, like converting a Celsius number to Fahrenheit. As such, custom processors can be extremely small, low-power, and fast compared to programmable processors. Custom processors and programmable processors often coexist in digital systems. For example, a TV set-top box may use a programmable processor to carry out most of the functions related to changing channels, controlling volume, etc., but may use custom processors to very quickly decompress the video.\vphantom\}
\par
The differences between microprocessor and custom circuit implementations relate to design metrics like system performance, such as power consumption, size, cost, and design time.
\par
non-recurring engineering cost (NRE)
\par
The transistors and wiresare fo1med as dozens of Layers on the surface of a chip;Each layer requires a set of masks. This cost for creating the masks required for IC fabrication is known as nonrecurring engineering (NRE) cost. the NRE cost for a full-custom IC type is very high, typically tens of millions dollars
\par
Processor = datapath + controller
\par
this chapter will introduce amethod to convert a high-level state machine into a circuit consisting of a controller connected to a datapath, which together are known as a processor
\par
Registers
\par
A register is a sequential component that can store multiple bits.
\par
Sequential logical circuit: Controller = register + combinational logic
\par
A sequential circuit is a circuit whose outputdepends not only on the circuit's present inputs, but also on the circuit's present state,which is all the bits cutently stored in the circuit. The circuit's state in turn depends on the past sequence of the circuit's input values.
\par
a circuit having a register and combinational logic, which together are known as a controller.
\par
The sequential circuit that implements an FSM is commonly called a controller.
\par
Soft core - Implementing programmable processors on FPGAs
\par
Point 4 represents the choice of implementing software on a programmable processor that is implemented on an FPGA. While that concept may seem strange, a programmable processor is just another circuit, so that circuit can be mapped to an FPGA just like any other circuit. Programmable processors mapped to FPGAs, known as soft core processors, are in fact becoming quite popular,
\par
Spin and respin
\par
Fabricating an IC is referred to as a smcon spin. commonly find errors that necessitate refabricating the IC, known as a respin (pronounced as "ree-spin").
\par
The term “field-programmable” in a FPGA
\par
Programming an FPGA occurs in the field, meaning in a designer;s lab, or office, or home, as opposed to in a fabrication plant. Hence the words "field-programmable” in the ~name.
\par
uP = datapath + control unit
\par
A programmable processor consists of two main parts: a datapath and a control unit.}
