# Statistical Signal Processing

This directory contains:
- The homework from my Msc. course "Processamento Estat√≠stico de Sinais", taught by Charles Casimiro Cavalcante at UFC.
- The homework is essentially the implementation of classic estimation and detection algorithms, such as:
    - Wiener filter
    - Forward and backward predictor filter
    - Method of moments (MoM) estimator
    - Method of least squares
    - Maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and detector
    - Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator and detector
    - Neyman-Pearson detector
    - Recursive algorithms
        - Deterministic gradient
        - Newton method
        - Least mean square (LMS)
        - Normalized least mean square (NLMS)
- These algorithms solve several problems, such as:
    - Linear fitting
    - Parameter estimation
- The compressed `.zip` file contains the code from colleges for the same course.
